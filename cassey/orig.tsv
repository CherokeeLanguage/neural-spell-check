15	The door locks were difficult to use which sounds such a minor complaint, but it maybe suggests the build quality of this new hotel could be better.
16	Screechy doors;
17	It is close to metro station and supermarkert.
18	Not fancy but clean and comfortable.
19	Tea - various kinds of black tea, but they have ran out of fruit or green tea.

34	Nothing from that hotel
35	The next morning I went at the same time and there was no bananas there.
36	We had a great breakfast plenty of choice the bar prices were a little high in the hotel but the bed was very large and comfortable
37	Now there is a bypass and the hotel is situated in an isolated place which once was the main A56 Chester Road but is now a dead end.
38	Lovely friendly staff.
39	Luckily we had a refurbished bathroom which was clean and functional but our co-travellers did not, and were unhappy with theirs.

65	Everything is so nice.
66	If you stay here, remember to try the free coffee machine in the room!
67	Bathroom very " tired" and needs modernising.
68	If I had to stay longer in that bathroom, I would even sue the hotel.
69	Will definitely be back .
70	We had to wait long periods of time for the lift because the renovators were using it!
71	The flat was very spacious and we felt very much at home, Internet connection was good.
72	The hotel is spotlessly clean.
73	The location was great as the hotel is located in the quiet and residential area of Torquay which is quite crowded.
74	Cosy hotel with warm staff and nice breakfast.
75	But it is new, build in the style of 200 years ago,.....
76	Beds are really comfortable - rooms nice and quiet
77	Bed extremely hard
78	Reservation team don't wanted to give me any good price which they have mentioned on other websites for promotion, I told them that I have found this valued price for 2 nights but I couldn't book online as my Internet is not that strong because I am driving Jaipur to Delhi and they said they are fully booked.
79	Quiet, very clean and friendly staff.
80	Not a criticism but you need a car
81	Air con in the rooms or fans to rent, a little hot sometimes.

86	Could have done with better cooking facilities.
87	Staff dont speak English nor German

89	Small, dated room.

104	The rooms were very dark and fitted out with cheap furniture, the location wasn't good
105	We had a great stay!
106	It's very well located near the main station and close to the center city.
107	It would be nice if the website could prompt us to confirm instead of assuming that we know.
108	the shower head
109	The owners of the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly.
110	modernised hotel in an excellent location; bathroom was particularly good.
111	The hotel is conveniently close to a train & metro station, with easy journeys to both central Amsterdam and Schiphol airport.
112	Only one set of bathroom supplies, despite two guests in room.
113	When finally got checked in to what was supposed to be a "club" room, we walked up the stairwell to our room, dirty, dingy, damp on the walls and no paint on the bannisters.
114	The breakfast was excellent.
115	There could be more personal needs in bathroom such as cotton, toothpaste and brush, comb, extra shampoo/soap, etc
116	Excellent value for money.
117	Could not fault it at all.
118	These beaches are very clean.
119	The room was slightly musty and dusty.

122	Very noisy inside and outside hotel , take earplugs !
123	The breakfast was great, nice variety.
124	Simply I can say that it is ideal for a family holidays.
125	Trash and recycling bins just outside the windows and we woke up every day at 06:00 by the the sound of the breaking glass, while the bides were being emptied.
126	There was a green flashing light I couldn't switch off located in the roof space, and the temperature of the room was too hot and no way of getting it down
127	As for the breakfast, there could be less variety and better quality.
128	We felt that the way in which the 'King Room' was advertised was disingenuous as reference to the shared bathroom wasn't clear enough.
129	The walls are paper thin, so you can hear conversations from the other rooms.
130	Fresh clean towels everyday and room service.
131	Nothing
132	the shower was cold but didnt bother us
133	In a bedroom the door was broken.
134	also we make great trip to atlas wif again a realy friendly driver from the riad.
135	Couldn't recommend highly enough.
136	Our room was huge and very comfortable!
137	So there was a lack of privacy.
138	It exudes class and quality.
139	Basic accommodation in the extreme.
140	Top Class.
141	4.
142	By the way, it was no signal or cartel of "Silver Sphere Inn" at the street.
143	And if the carpets were thoroughly washed and cleaned throughout, or better still, replaced, especially in our room, I would find nothing to fault about this hotel given its 3 star rating which is accurate.
144	They booked a different hotel for us and claimed it was the same price which in fact was $12 cheaper.
145	Dirty pool
146	Comfortable bed, Outdoor bathroom, Great breakfast, Nice environment
147	These are minor flaws.
148	Wifi was not accessible from one device
149	more variaty for the breakfast
150	They called to say the room was ready but when we got back they said they didn't have a family available so we had to gave a smaller room and change to a family the next night .
151	Whole experience was excellent.
152	The cottage was.quiet.
153	The breakfast is very expensive.

156	Good location and good staff
157	There is no restaurant in the hotel.
158	It was around 10.30/11pm, but I had to be up early for work, so I called reception and they came up straight away and asked him to close the door - and I got a great nights sleep!

171	Nothing...!
172	Only thing heating in our room, was hot n than cold.
173	Very friendly staff
174	The floor height is such that the last step is only a couple of inches wide and high.
175	We had a room at the inner patio of the building, which meant that we had a small window that looked out upon the inside, and you hear other hotel guests pretty well: walking around / coming home / checking out in the early morning.
176	The hotel doesn't have its own restaurant which makes it a mission to get any food, even just a snack - the hotel is situated far out of town in the mountains.
177	A must for anyone choosing Mogan for a vacation.
178	None
179	Half the flutes were closed.
